\subsubsection{Data Collection}


\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./Figures/data.png}
    \caption{Data Collection Process.}
    \label{fig:datacollection}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Textual Data Collection}
The textual data for conditions and treatments was collected from the NHS (National Health Service) website, specifically from the section dedicated to medical conditions. This section provides comprehensive information about various health conditions, including their symptoms, causes, treatments, and other relevant details.

Efforts were made to systematically gather information from multiple pages within this section of the NHS website. This involved extracting structured data about different medical conditions, ensuring accuracy and consistency in the dataset.

By utilizing reputable sources such as the NHS website, we aim to ensure the reliability and credibility of the collected data, thereby enhancing the effectiveness and validity of the Machine Learning (ML) and Large Language Model (LLM) models trained on this dataset.


\textbf{Image Data Acquisition}
The chest X-ray images used in this study were obtained from two primary sources: the CheXpert dataset and the NIH Chest X-ray dataset (CXR14).

The CheXpert dataset is a large publicly available dataset consisting of chest radiographs and associated radiological reports. It contains a diverse range of chest X-ray images with annotations for various abnormalities, allowing for the training and evaluation of machine learning models.

The NIH Chest X-ray dataset (CXR14)  is another widely used dataset comprising chest X-ray images collected from the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. It provides a substantial collection of chest X-ray images with associated labels, enabling researchers to develop and validate algorithms for various medical imaging tasks.

Images from both datasets were collected in various file formats and resolutions, reflecting the real-world variability encountered in medical imaging. Preprocessing techniques were applied to standardize the images and enhance their quality before further analysis.

\textbf{Textual Data Transformation}
To enhance the utility and accessibility of the textual data collected, a comprehensive transformation process was employed. This involved two main steps, each leveraging the collective capabilities of several Large Language Models (LLMs) to reduce model bias and improve the diversity of the data interpretations.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Symptom Summarization}
    The first step in the transformation process was to distill complex medical descriptions from the collected datasets into concise bullet points. These summaries are crucial for quick reference within the Medibot system and for ensuring that users receive straightforward and digestible medical information. We utilized a blend of advanced LLMs, including GPT-4 and Llama3-70b, to achieve a balance of accuracy and clarity, minimizing bias by integrating multiple model insights.
    
    
    \item \textbf{Generation of Interactive Queries}
    Following the summarization, the next step was to create dynamic and interactive content that would facilitate a naturalistic interaction between users and Medibot. This involved generating potential questions that patients might ask based on their symptoms, as well as crafting statements that patients could use to describe their symptoms accurately to a doctor. For this task, a combination of LLMs including GPT-3.5, Llama3-70b, and the Mixture of Experts (MoE) model Mixtral22b*8 were used. This ensemble approach ensured that the generated questions and descriptions were varied, realistic, and free from the biases typically associated with single-model outputs.
    
\end{itemize}
By integrating multiple LLMs at each stage of the textual data transformation process, we mitigated the risks of model bias, ensuring that the outputs were nuanced and broadly applicable. This methodology supports Medibot's goal to provide reliable and user-friendly diagnostic interactions.

\textbf{Data Augmentation for Image Data}
To ensure that our AI models are robust and capable of handling real-world variability in medical imaging, we applied a comprehensive data augmentation strategy to our image dataset. This approach involved simulating a variety of conditions that images might undergo in practical settings, particularly those captured using mobile devices.

\begin{itemize}
    \item 
    \textbf{Augmentation Techniques Implemented}
    We employed a diverse set of image transformations to mimic various photographic effects and artifacts. These included:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Moire Patterns} to simulate the interference effects seen in digital images.
        \item \textbf{Blur} to replicate out-of-focus images.
        \item \textbf{Motion Blur} to mimic the effect of camera movement during exposure.
        \item \textbf{Glare} (both matte and glossy) to represent light reflections on different surfaces.
        \item \textbf{Tilt} for angular misalignments.
        \item \textbf{Brightness Adjustments} (both increases and decreases).
        \item \textbf{Contrast Adjustments} (both increases and decreases).
        \item \textbf{Rotation and Translation} to simulate changes in camera orientation and position.
        \item \textbf{Exposure Variation} to mimic under and over-exposed images.
    \end{itemize} 

    \item \textbf{Application of Augmentations}
    To integrate these augmentations effectively, we randomly applied between one to five of these filters to 70\% of the images in our dataset. This method allowed us to create a range of scenarios, from minor alterations to more severely altered images, thereby preparing our models to perform reliably under various photographic conditions.
    
    \item 
    \textbf{Objective and Benefits}
    The objective of implementing these diverse augmentation techniques was to train our AI models to recognize and interpret medical images accurately, regardless of the quality or source of the image. This is particularly crucial for images taken from mobile devices in less controlled environments. As a result, our models demonstrate enhanced adaptability and reduced susceptibility to overfitting, ensuring reliable diagnoses even from sub-optimal image inputs.
